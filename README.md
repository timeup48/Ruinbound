Deadwood Keep is a gritty, tile-based survival simulation where you fight to survive in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by the undead. Combining the deep, emergent gameplay and complex AI of classic roguelikes with rich crafting, base-building, and character progression systems, Deadwood Keep challenges you to outthink both the environment and relentless zombie hordes.

Manage your hunger, thirst, fatigue, and mental state while scavenging for resources, crafting essential gear, and fortifying your shelter. Every decision matters: from how you manage limited supplies, to choosing your characterâ€™s skills and traits, to navigating the dynamic AI-driven behaviors of zombies that see, hear, and hunt you with eerie persistence.

Rendered in minimalist, Dwarf Fortress-inspired tiles, the game offers a vast simulated world full of danger, opportunity, and unexpected events. Will you carve out a sanctuary, or become just another victim of the apocalypse?

Survive. Adapt. Endure.
